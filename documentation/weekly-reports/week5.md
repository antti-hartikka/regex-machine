# Week 5
_10 hours_

In this week, after the peer review, I improved the project a bit. 
Compiler has some grammar checking and throws PatternSyntaxException in case of discrepancies in the regex pattern. 
I wrote quickly a new class for performance testing: it returns a LineChart object for the gui containing data from single test. 
The test is at least for now hard coded, but it was easy to generate couple of line charts to take screen shots from. 


This week hasn't provided any questions or thoughts, I think I'll just have to finish remaining work and polish the project to the final form.
