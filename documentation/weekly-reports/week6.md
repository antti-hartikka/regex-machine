# Week 6
_15 hours_

In this week, I had a decent fight with the yDocs tool to generate UML diagrams. 
After this I wrote rest of the documentation, polished the code and comments a bit, and made sure that everything should be good. 
This has been very interesting project to work with and I think I have learned a lot working with self implemented data structures. 
It has been also a joy to see what is happening under the hood.
