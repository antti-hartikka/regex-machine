# Week 3

I started this week by improving testing, and it was pretty good idea, as it made rest of the week easier when I didn't have to worry about breaking my code.
I did implement a little bit more grammar to the engine, and I managed to implement my own arraylist, stack, and hashset, so I had the honour to 
replace the Java's default library imports with my own.

So what did I learn this week? 
* Unit testing makes everything easier, although I already knew it, but this time it hit different. 
* When writing new code, it shoud be done in a calm and firm manner. I have a bad habit of writing too fast and fix after, maybe I'll learn out from this.

Everything is going pretty well, next weeks jobs will include implementing regex grammar handlers and more testing.
