# Week 4
_10 hours_

In this week, I worked on the {a,b} syntax and it sure turned to be quite tricky, but I managed to make it work. 
I also started writing implementation document and testing document, and I think I'll work with these more in the next week. 
The engine is in good shape now. The main features are now done, I think. 
I need to work with error handling next, and make it throw something nice to the user if there is wrong syntax used or something. 

I think I am in good position to start vibing myself to finish line: there are lot of work to do, but I have started a lot of them, so there is kind of clear path for me to follow.
