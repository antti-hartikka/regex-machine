# Week 2
_20 hours of work_

This has been very interesting week, I think there has been some kind of break trough on implementation. Altough it is pretty easy to just draw different 
graphs representing different states and transitions between said states, the programming environment is really difficult place to work with. 

I used few hours on research finding a sensible way to implement this engine, and I think the algorithm is going to be good choice to solve this problem.
I also finally got the project specification document done, although it was last weeks assign. 

The programming is going well: there is some bugs of course, but there is a working core implementation of the regex engine that matches strings 
with ()?+| syntaxes, and i belive that the rest is easy to implement now after I got these working. 

Testing is something that needs a lot of improvements. I have one test class that checks if different texts and regex patterns is returned as true, but 
there is no false-checking or anything else so this subject will be in close inspection next week.

I think that everything else is quite clear, but I'm not sure how to test individual classes. Maybe it will be clearer next week when I get into it though.

Next in progress will be test improvements and more syntax handling in the compiler. I think everything is going quite good for now!
