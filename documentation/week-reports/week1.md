## Report for week 1

This week has been a bit too busy to get all the things done that should have been, but I 
have achieved some progress. It took some time to decide the topic for the project, but I 
think this regex engine will keep myself interested till the end.
The idea about the regex engine is quite clear, but the implmentation is still a bit mystery; I haven't got much more time for research this week but I managed to do a bit searching in the internet about the nature of this problem.
I have initialized the project with maven, and i wrote simple ui with JavaFX to get started with.
There isn't much to say about unclear subjects for this matter, since everything is a bit fuzzy for now. I'd like to thing that next week is going to be enlightning one, after i've done some research and written the requirements document, that is my next step.
